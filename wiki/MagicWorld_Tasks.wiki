  == Beta (29.06) ==

  == pre Final (06.07) ==
  # savegames and replaying of levels (for better score) --> amauri done. 
  # level with torch switch -> *???*
    * one torch lighting opens door to ingredient (with instruction)
    * one torch extinguish opens door to ingredient
  # level with icecle (only pass enemy by killing it with icecle)  -> *???*
  # icicle in editor -> Pascal
  # level textures -> Pascal
  # gray out background in casting mode
  # animation for no gravity -> Pascal
  # level transition -->amauri
  # instruction screen for level and spells (AGREE? )
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions)
  # save configuration (save settings like sound/resolutions)--> amauri
  # replace or add better fitting FREE sounds and music
  # warm/cold spell: better gravition physics --> please explain!!
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?)
  # BUG with aiming on gamepad --> pascal (please contact me (christopher) if have an idea for solution or search todos)
  # track textures -> Pascal asks: As in mine cart tracks?
  # give magican another wand and put every wand in one animation ->Pascal
  # more easier start levels!
  # check level 7 if the new door implementation works like expected with level idea --> I think its Johns Level --> Check it! ->John
  # fullscreen option in menu --> amauri?

== Final (13.07) ==
  

 === optional ===
  # Sound menu (turn sound and/or music on/off) -> Amauri
  # electric spell graphics -> Pascal (current one should work)
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)


== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.
