  == Beta (29.06) ==

  == pre Final (06.07) ==
  # REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> john
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
  # level with icecle (only pass enemy by killing it with icecle)  -> *???*
  # level textures -> Pascal
    * one texture for ever switch type
    * rope or chain
  # fix behavior if you reach last level -> show congratulation and finish screen, show credits and continue to main menu --> Amauri
     * Show which button to press, also add JUMP-Key (NOT ONLY ENTER)
  # give magican another wand and put every wand in one animation ->Pascal
  # check level 7 if the new door implementation works like expected with level idea --> I think its Johns Level --> Check it! ->John
  # Texture to visualize the track push/pull platform can move -> Pascal
  # effect/bug shadow creatures push created matter. is this wanted?
  # tuorial levels: planning for the first levels with instructions to learn game mechanic (level 1-3) -> Pascal


== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # BUG: game exit throws exception
  # Reset Game profile
  # Iceblock instead of color change when freezing a bat
  # show level in background in the level selction screen

 === optional ===
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)



== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?) solved by colorizing
