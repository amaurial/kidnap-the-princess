== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: no jumping and turn direction possible on upwards moving plattform
  # BUG: push/pull bounding bounding box
  # Reset Game profile
  # Iceblock instead of color change when freezing a bat
  # Show level in background in the level selection screen
  # Sounds for: REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> all (use dropbox to collect all sounds. At the end team will decide which to use) [tipps http://www.freesound.org/ )
     * jumping
     * dying
     * level complete
     * spell casting
     * backgroung music
     * ingredient collected
     * spell hit enemy
     * menu sound
     * laughter if enemy is killd by icicle
 # fix behavior if you reach last level -> show congratulation and finish screen, show credits and continue to main menu --> Amauri . Done
     * Show which button to press, also add JUMP-Key (NOT ONLY ENTER)
  # new rune texture for fire -> Pascal
  # BUG: aiming aid. warm and cold spell sometimes draw twice. (happens with game pad)
  # switch feedback - show that switch is activated (weigth switch & electricity)
  # KEYPAD MAPPING
  # level start background (where the available spells are shown)
  # Draw 3D level exit -> Pascal
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
  # Better looking torch texture -> Pascal
  # Another texture for moveable platforms -> Pascal
  # Use die animation -> John
  # effect/bug shadow creatures push created matter. is this wanted?
  # Manual
  # 5 Screenshots, Groupname, Game Description
  # presentation plan
  # optional: show used mana for spell during casting mode
  # optional: highlight objects that are infuenced by push/pull while casting
  # optional: startgame - story from game (pictures or aimation)
  # optional: HUD ELements nicht so nahe am Bildschirmrand
  # optional: button for spell under the rune in the HUD
  # optional: matter fading -> at the start no transperence, at the end faster fading out


 === optional ===
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)
  # optimize platform textures -> Pascal
  # Bigger and better "wall" textures -> Pascal



== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?) solved by colorizing
