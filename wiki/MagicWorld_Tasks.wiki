  == Beta (29.06) ==

  == pre Final (13.07) ==
  # savegames and replaying of levels (for better score) --> 80% done. missing show the statistics. amauri
  # level with torch switch -> *???*
    * one torch lighting opens door to ingredient (with instruction)
    * one torch extinguish opens door to ingredient
  # level with icecle (only pass enemy by killing it with icecle)  -> *???*
  # icicle in editor -> Pascal
  # electric spell graphics -> Pascal
  # level textures -> Pascal
  # slow motion while casting -> *???*
  # push & pull no casting with aiming function...
  # gray out background in casting mode
  # slowmotion for all objects 
 
  # level transition -->amauri
  # instruction screen for level and spells (AGREE? )
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions)
  # save configuration (save settings like sound/resolutions)--> amauri
  # replace or add better fitting FREE sounds and music
  # vulcano
  # warm/cold spell: better gravition physics --> please explain!!
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect
  # recreate push pull objects with switch or something like this
  # put steps(several plattforms over each other) in levels where you could fall down (some level)
  # BUG with aiming on gamepad --> pascal (please contact me (christopher) if have an idea for solution)
  # track textures
  # you should move with moveable plattforms
  # avoid choosing same spell twice
  # give magican another wand and put every wand in one animation
  # more easier start levels!
  # more intuitive displaying of collected and needed ingridients
  # check level 7 if the new door implementation works like expected with level idea --> I think its Johns Level --> Check it!

  # Sound menu (turn sound and/or music on/off)


== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.
