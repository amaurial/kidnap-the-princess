  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * work on phase 1 problems first

= in Progress =




= TODO =
==PHASE 1 - core mechanics/game elements ==
  * no gravitation spell -> gravitation should influence created matter (if it is falling down) 
  * matter spell casting
    * matter spell seems to crash the game once in a while
    * created matter needs to fall down after casting
    * matter should be created directly not after hitting something (casting direction is like throwing the created block)
  * better spell casting 
    * spells shouldnt move if they being casted while not moving 
    * spell moving in drecton of movement (also up and down) NEED FIX   FOR DIAGONAL DIRECTION --> IF JUMPING ALWAYS FLY UP --> John
  * player controls
    * other key for jump (up key should set direction for spell and for floating in no gravity area)


==PHASE 2 - playable prototype ==
  * Mana implementation (manabar on overlay, diffrent castig cost for bigger spell, balanced mana regeneration)
  * standing on top of froozen enemies 
  * icicle (falls down when hit by warming spell and kills enemys that got hit by the icicle)
  * levels to show diffrent combinations of spells
    * matter + gravitation spell
    * caging an enemy
    * kill enemy with icicle -> exit door opens (or enemy leaves a key)
    * 


==PHASE 3 - fine tuning / extra stuff ==
  * no gravity spell -> player must be able to move in all directions in spell sphere (like swimming)
  * background graphics
  * character graphics
  * no gravitation graphics
  * casted spells weakens with time (gets smaller/ fading out slowly)
  * elapsed time on overlay 
  * level balancing
  * frozen tiles change movement for player and enemies




= done =

  * gravity spell --> Marian
  * warming and freezing enemies 
  * implemented moving camera
  * improving project structure - Marian
  * enemy impl - AI --> John
    - Gegner laufen jetzt dem Spieler hinterher
  * spell moving in drecton of movement (also up and down) --> John
    - Zauber kÃ¶nnen nach oben und nach unten fliegen
  * picture for frozen enemies  -->christopher
  * spell impl general stuff - Amauri --> Continued Christopher: BASICS ARE DONE
