 === optional ===
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # Bigger and better "wall" textures -> Pascal
  # startgame - story from game (pictures or aimation)
  # HUD ELements nicht so nahe am Bildschirmrand
  # button for spell under the rune in the HUD
  # show level in background in the level selection screen
  # Adjust levels with old platforms and adjust value responisble for the "player ground sinking"


== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
