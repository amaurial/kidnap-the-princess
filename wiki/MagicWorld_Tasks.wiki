  # BUG: no jumping and turn direction possible on upwards moving plattform
  # REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> john
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
  # level with icecle (only pass enemy by killing it with icecle)  -> *???*
  # fix behavior if you reach last level -> show congratulation and finish screen, show credits and continue to main menu --> Amauri
     * Show which button to press, also add JUMP-Key (NOT ONLY ENTER)
  # give magican another wand and put every wand in one animation ->Pascal
  # effect/bug shadow creatures push created matter. is this wanted?
  # tuorial levels: planning for the first levels with instructions to learn game mechanic (level 1-3) -> Pascal
  # new rune texture for fire

== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: game exit throws exception - not happening anymore
  # Reset Game profile
  # Iceblock instead of color change when freezing a bat
  # show level in background in the level selction screen
  #Sounds
     #spring
     #sterben
     #level beendet
     #spell casting
     #backgroung music
     #sammeln
     #spell on enemy

 === optional ===
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)



== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?) solved by colorizing
