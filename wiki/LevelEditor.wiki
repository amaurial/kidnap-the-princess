Describes how to use Gleed2D to make levels for magic world.

= Introduction =

Although the level loading is not completely implemented yet it is already fairly


= Setup =

 # Download Gleed2D here: http://gleed2d.codeplex.com/
 # Start it and press F9 or use Tools->Settings to bring up the settings menu.
 # Choose a default content root folder. This should be the path to the projects content root folder. In my case it is "C:\MagicWorld\Platformer\Content".
 # Make sure DefaultTextureOrigin mode is set to TextureCenter(should be the default anyway).

= Creating levels (Quick step guide) =

||Layer||Description||
||Zero||Has only one Textures that is always displayed and never moved. It spans the whole screen and represents the one "most far away".||
||Background||The actual level background that is scrolled when the player moves. This layer does not collide with anything.||
||Middle||This is where all the platforms and the ground of the level go. Everything in here is included in collision checks.||
||Front||Behaves like Background but is drawn in over middle.||
||special||This layer holds all information like starting point, exit point and level bounds.||

 # Start by creating layers and name them according to their ingame alias (see above).
 # Add textures to the layers (except special layer) to create your level. Do not scale or rotate textures as it is not supported yet.
 # Add a circle primitive to the special layer and name it start to add the starting point for the level.
 # Do the same again but name the circle exit to set the exit point of the level.
 # Finally place two rectangle primitives. One at the top left corner of the level and the other at the bottom right corner of the level. Name them rightCorner and leftCorner according to their position.
 # Save the file and add it to your project, then open it.
 # The first and last element in the xml are called Level. Change them to Gleed2dLevelLoader (note the lower case d).

Note: Please name the xml level files "levelN.xml" where N is the number of the level and put the xml files in the LevelData folder.

= Special layer =

As mention above the special layer holds information instead of textures.
What was not covered before is the placement of the collectibles.
Collectibles are added through circle primitives, but instead of naming them you have to add a custom property to them (John please elaborate!).

--> Ingredients must be on the Ingredients layer + use "Ingredient" as custom property in a circle, the property must be set to Gem

In the future this layer will also be used to place enemies and their waypoints as well as all other game objects.
